# JavaScript Objects
### Review
* What is an object?

* What is a field?

* What is a method?

### JS Objects
* An *object* is a collection of *properties*.

* A *property* is a named value (similar to a `key` in a `HashMap` or a `field` in a Java class).

* In JavaScript an object's property can store a value of **any** type.

* Objects have *data properties*, which are values that describe an object's state. (In OOP, this would be the value assigned to some field on a particular *instance* of an object)

* Objects also have *methods*. A *method* is a function assigned as a value to a property of an object.

* Methods can perform operations using the data properties of each instance of an object.
