# Array Methods Group Exercise
### Introduction / Goals
Instead of going over array methods one by one as a group, you are going to be split into teams (or pairs), assigned one or more JavaScript array methods to research, and then you will present your findings on how the method works to the rest of the class.  

Your goal is to gain both understanding of the method(s) you have been assigned, as well as gain experience using the official documentation (as well as other resources) to gain understanding of existing methods.  

You will have 1 hour to research and prepare your presentation on the method(s) before we begin presenting to the group.  

Your presentation may take the form of slides, a physical demonstration (using team members and pieces of paper and moving them around as the method does), or anything else you believe will most successfully convey not only the usage of the method, but also its inner workings.  

### Considerations :
* Do not simply parrot the documentation

* You will be expected to know not only how to use these methods, but also how to explain what they are doing in an interview environment

* Inform the class not only what the method's inputs and return values are, but also HOW it is achieving the output.

### Array Methods :

* shift

* unshift

* join

* slice

* splice

* reverse

* sort

* indexOf

* lastIndexOf

* forEach

* map

* filter

* reduce
