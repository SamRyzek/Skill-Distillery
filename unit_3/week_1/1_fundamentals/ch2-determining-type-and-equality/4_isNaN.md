### `isNaN()`
* As we have seen, `NaN` is NEVER equal to any other value (including itself)
  
* To evaluate a value and determine if it is not-a-number there is a global method on the Number class `isNaN()`:
  
```javascript
isNaN(NaN);       // true
isNaN(undefined); // true
isNaN({});        // true

isNaN(true);      // false
isNaN(null);      // false
isNaN(37);        // false

// strings
isNaN("37");      // false: "37" is converted to the number 37 which is not NaN

isNaN("37.37");   // false: "37.37" is converted to the number 37.37 which is not NaN

isNaN("123ABC");  // true:  parseInt("123ABC") is 123 but Number("123ABC") is NaN

isNaN("");        // false: the empty string is converted to 0 which is not NaN

isNaN(" ");       // false: a string with spaces is converted to 0 which is not NaN
```
