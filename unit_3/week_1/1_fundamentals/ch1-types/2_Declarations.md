# Declarations
* Unlike Java, JavaScript is an untyped language. This means that when declaring variables, you do not have to designate their type.

* To declare a JavaScript variable, use the `var` keyword and assign the variable a name.

```javascript
var age = 30;
```

* JavaScript variable declaration can occur anywhere in a `.js` file, and the variable will fall into one of JavaScript's two scopes.
  * A *Global Variable* is defined outside of a function, anywhere in your code
  * A *Local Variable* is defined within a function.


### Variable Names
* Must **not** be reserved words
* Must **not** start with a number
* Can start with an underscore (`_`)
* Are case-sensitive

```javascript
var break; // Invalid...'break' is reserved
var 9hello; // Invalid...begins with a number
var _name; // Valid...underscores are fine
var age; // != var Age;...case-sensitivity
```
