# Null & Undefined
* `null` represents the absence of a value.

* `null` is **not** a default value for a variable. It represents an intentional choice, potentially signifying the absence of data in correctly functioning code.

* `undefined` also corresponds to a non-value. However, unlike `null`, it represents the value of uninitialized variables, or parameters that have no value associated with them.

* You can think of `null` values as non-error representations of nothing, whereas `undefined` usually corresponds to the lack of a value that was expected.  

```javascript
var nope; // undefined

nope = null; // null
```
