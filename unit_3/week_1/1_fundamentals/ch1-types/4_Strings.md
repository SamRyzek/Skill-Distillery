# Strings
* A string can be defined with either single or double quotes:

```javascript
var firstName = "Steven";
var lastName = 'Gregory';
```

* String comparison in JavaScript is possible using the `==` comparator:

```javascript
var x = 'hello';
x == 'hello' // true
x == 'squirrel' // false
```

### Hands On
1. Create a new String using double quotes, include single quotes inside of it.
  * Type the variable name into the console and press return, what happened when you included the single quotes within the double quotes?
  * Now wrap single quotes around double quotes, what is the result?

2. Add to strings with the '+' operator.

3. Subtract one string from another with the '-' operator.

4. JavaScript's strings are collections of characters (similar to Java), in JavaScript, this means that you can access individual characters of a string with *subscript notation* similar to Array access in Java:

```javascript
var greet = "Hello World";
greet[0]; // "H"
```

  * Try it for yourself!
