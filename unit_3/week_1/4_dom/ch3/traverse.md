0: Create an HTML file named `traverse.html` and a JavaScript file named `traverse.js`  

1: Write a well formed HTML document in `traverse.html` and add an `<h1>` that says 'hello world'.  

2: Import your `traverse.js` file into your `traverse.html` file using `<script src=''></script>`  

3: In your JS file, select the `<h1>` element, use jQuery's `.text()` method to change 'hello world' to 'hello your name'.  

4: Add an unordered list (`<ul>`) of 5 list items to the HTML (don't put any text between the `<li>`s).  

5: In `traverse.js` create a javascript array with five string values in it.  

6: Use a selector to access the unordered list and store it in a variable.  

7: Look up jQuery's `.each` method (linked below) to iterate over the children of your list. Use `text()` to insert the values from your array into each of the list items.

**Hint Inside of the `.each()` method you reference the current element you are on in your iteration by $(this).**
