### Traversing the DOM with the `Document` object
* One of the `Window` object's properties is `Document`

* The `Document` interface inherits from the `HTMLDocument` interface, which provides an expansive list of properties and methods to interact with the HTML elements. The `Document` allows us to:
  * select HTML elements
  * change properties on HTML elements
  * create new HTML elements
  * setup event listeners

### Hands On
* In a chrome console, type in window.document and see what is returned.
