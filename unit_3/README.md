### Overview
This unit is all about JavaScript. We will be learning JS basics, using the jQuery library, integrating JS into our Spring and Spring REST applications, and finally exploring the front end framework Angular.

We will also be about propping you up as a developer. By the time you are done with this program you need to feel comfortable standing on your own two feet, and finding your own answers is a big part of that. We are going to be there for you, to help and guide you for the rest of the program, but we are going to encourage you to read errors, determine what isn't working and use the resources you have to find a fix.
