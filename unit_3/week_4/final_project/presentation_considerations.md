# Presentation Considerations

* ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS:
  * What did you do?
  * Why did you do it?
  * Who did you do it for?
  * How did you do it?
  * What do you still have to do?
  * Knowing what you know now, what would you have done differently?

* Look at and direct your presentation towards the audience (not the floor, sides of the room or a computer)

* DO NOT TOUCH THE COMPUTER WHILE YOU ARE PRESENTING -> have a non-speaker operate the computer

* Be excited about what you did, you built it, if you don't seem passionate about it or engaged, there is no way that the audience will care.

* Make your demo's snappy and interesting. No one needs you to explain that you can login/register/logout...any site with users has that ability and the members of your audience are intimately familiar with that functionality.

* Make slides

* Put specific code snippets on slides. Know what they are, have them look good, talk about them.

* Do not under any circumstances switch over to an IDE and try to find code to show

* Do not lecture the audience on programming concepts, talk about the approach you took, tradeoffs.

* Discuss What you did (demo) /how (languages)/ why (who is this for, what problem does it solve).

* Practice your presentation. Whoever is presenting, assume things are going fine behind you, don't constantly look back and wait for the person on the computer...know this timing ahead of time, vamp with talking points during processes that take longer.

* Don't read slides

* Don't show code/functionality if you aren't going to discuss it.

* Don't say anything political or inflammatory

* Don't have huge chunks of comments in the code you show (assume your audience is relatively non-technical).

* Try to have everyone talk, try to have everyone talk for roughly the same percentage of time.

* Demos should be as long as they have to be...do not try to stretch this out past the point that it is interesting/relevant. Get to the meat of functionality quickly to get audience to buy in.

* Always pre-calibrate your presentation. Know how zoomed in things need to be before starting presentation. This can be achieved by actually doing dry runs on presentation.

* Plan transition from speaker to next speaker. Introduce the next speaker (pass the torch).

* First presenter introduces whole team

* Don't stand in front of projector.
