### Pitch Prompts
* You will have 1 minute (strictly timed), to pitch a project idea.

* The pitch should express the purpose of the application, the key functionality, and a short summary of the approach (i.e. technologies/design principles)

* There are no constraints, although there are considerations to keep in mind:
  * you will have 10-days to develop the application, not including weekends.
  * you will be working with a team of fellow students
  * you will build the application from the ground up, not modify an existing open source project
  * you must complete the MVP of your application by COB Monday (~4 days of in class development)

* You may pitch as many ideas as you wish (within reason)...each pitch will be allotted 1 minute.

* After all pitches are complete your cohort will have a secret vote, the projects which receive the most votes will be defended by groups of students who are interested in them.

* Following the defense, groups will be assigned by the instructors, and you will begin work.

* This should encourage you to bring ideas for applications to the table that are interesting and that you would like to work on!
