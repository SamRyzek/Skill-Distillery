## Presentation  
* On Friday at 10:00 AM, you will present your project.

* Your presentation will be recorded and posted to YouTube.

* You will present in front of your cohort, the other cohort(s) onsite, any alumni who wish to attend, the instructors, and potentially some friends of Skill Distillery.

* Your presentation should be a refined, practiced, professional presentation:
  * You will perform a demonstration of the core functionality of your application
  * You will discuss your approach, including code samples, with visual examples in the form of slides (this will prevent your from sloppily clicking around an IDE looking for the code, and also ensure that the code sample is big enough to be read by the people in the back)
  * Don't forget to discuss the group process, inspiration for the application, and discussion of the problem that your application solves
  * Every group member will have a speaking role
  * No member of your group should speak and control the computer simultaneously...speak to the audience, not the screen
  * Dress to impress.
  * Aim for 10-15 minutes in length
