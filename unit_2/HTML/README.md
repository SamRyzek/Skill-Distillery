## HTML Basics
### Objectives

* Use HTML tags to define the semantic structure of web documents.

### Topics

* [HTML Basics](1_htmlBasics.md)
* [HTML Hello World](2_htmlHelloWorld.md)
* [HTML Attributes](3_htmlAttributes.md)
* [HTML Glossary](4_html_glossary.md)
* [HTML Forms](5_htmlForms.md)

### HTML Self-study and Practice
Complete the first three Units of the CodeAcademy 'HTML & CSS' self-study course, and the "Forms" section of either the Quackit or HtmlDog tutorials (or both), linked below. Explore the HTML sections in the additional resources linked below. You do not need to complete all of these sections but you are expected to have a solid understanding of HTML upon completion. A few of the resources also have some CSS content included. Feel free to look this over, however we will be providing you with some separate resources specifically targeting CSS basics.

You should have at least a fundamental understanding of the following HTML elements:

* Basic HTML document structure
* *Structural tags*: h1-h6, p, hr, blockquote, ul, ol, li, properly-nested lists.
* *Links*: a, href.
* *Images*: img, src, alt.
* *Tables*: table, tr, th, td, colspan, rowspan.
* *Forms*: form, input types, radio, checkbox, select/options, submit.

#### HTML Resources
* [Codecademy][Codecademy] (First three 'Units')
* [Quackit: HTML Formatting][quackit] (Section: HTML Forms)
* [Htmldog][Htmldog] (Section: Forms)
* [Building Your First Web Page][BuildingYourFirstWebPage]
* [Mozilla Developers Network - HTML][Mozilla]

### Content Assessment

Your goal is to get comfortable with creating a well-structured HTML document and adding elements to it, without needing to Google the basic syntax and tag names.  After self-study and practice, you will have time to complete an assignment that we will assess in class to prove your knowledge of the subject. This assignment will require you to extend your HTML knowledge beyond what is covered in the tutorials.  **DO NOT** put off the self-study until the last minute.
