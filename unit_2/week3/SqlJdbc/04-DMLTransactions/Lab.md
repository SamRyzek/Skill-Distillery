## Lab

Throughout these labs, read carefully and be sure to consider whether and when to start and commit or roll back transactions.

1. Insert your own address into the address table, then determine the address ID that was assigned.

2. Using your new address ID, insert yourself into the staff table.

3. With a single statement, set your supervisor_id to be the manager of your store.

4. Using an INSERT with a subquery, add a record for yourself in the customer table by retrieving appropriate fields from your staff record and including any other necessary customer items.

5. You've convinced the company to hire your roommate. Add their new staff record using your same address and store information. Make yourself their supervisor.

6. Delete all the payment records.

7. What â€” are you nuts!? Get those payment records back!
