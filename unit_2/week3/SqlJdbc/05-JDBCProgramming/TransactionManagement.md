## Transaction Management

* A DBMS can log all DML operations in a session as part of a transaction.

  * At your request, the DBMS will either:

    * Commit the entire transaction, making your operations permanent and visible to other users.

    * Rollback the entire transaction, completely undoing all DML operations.

  * When you commit or rollback a transaction, a new transaction can begin.

* The default behavior of a `Connection` object is to automatically commit after executing each statement.

  * In this case, each statement is a single, independent transaction.

* To turn off autocommit mode, use `setAutoCommit(false)`.

  * You can then use the `commit()` or `rollback()` methods of your `Connection` object to manage your transactions.

  * The `getAutoCommit()` method of your `Connection` object returns true when autocommit mode is on.

In most cases, autocommit is not desirable â€” you don't have the ability to check errors and warnings and program appropriately, or to treat multiple individual statements as parts of a single transaction, or to set transaction savepoints (if your DBMS supports them).

#### Transaction Side Effects

* Some DBMSs, notably Oracle, automatically commit the current transaction any time you execute a DDL statement.
* Committing or rolling back the current transaction frees all locks.
* Committing the current transaction frees the update locks associated with an updatable cursor, thus forcing the cursor closed.
