## Lab

1. Write a program to print a listing of all film titles and replacement costs, and the total of all replacement costs at the end.

2. Write a program that uses a PreparedStatement to retrieve the id, name, and email of all employees of a store. The statement should take the store ID as its only parameter. Prompt the user for a store ID and use the response to run the query and print the results.

3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a SQL statement (using System.in or a simple GUI, as you prefer). The program should then determine if the statement is a query or not, and execute it using the appropriate method. If it is a query, just print out the number of rows found. If it is a DML or other statement, print the number of rows affected.

4. Modify your solution to SQLExec.java: if the statement is executed as a query, use ResultSetMetaData to determine the number of columns retrieved by the query. For each row, print out all columns.

5. Modify your solution to SQLExec.java: if the statement is executed as a query, use ResultSetMetaData to determine the number of columns retrieved by the query. For each row, print out all columns.
