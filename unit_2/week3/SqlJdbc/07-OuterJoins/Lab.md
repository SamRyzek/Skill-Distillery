## Lab

1. Using joins, write queries to:

   a. List all stores, their city and state, and their manager's names; include stores with no manager.

   b. List all stores, their city and state, and their manager's names, and the manager's street address; include stores with no manager.

   c. List the name and city of every employee who doesn't have a username.

2. Using joins, write queries to:

   a. List the rental date, return date, and payment amount (where applicable) of all rentals including those that have no payments.

   b. List only the rentals that have no payments.

3. Write a query to list employee assignments. It should retrieve employee id and full name, their store location, and their supervisor's id.

4. Modify the query from 3 to include the last name of their supervisor.

5. Modify the query from 4 to also list all employees, even those without supervisors.

6. Modify the query from 5 so that:

   * Include the name of each employee's store manager.
   * The results are sorted by store location and supervisor names.
   * Employee name is returned as a single "Firstname Lastname" string.
   * Column headers are unambiguous.
