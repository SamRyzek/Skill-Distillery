# Persisting Multiple Entities

* Persisting nested entities requires some additional effort.

* First you must create both the parent and the child entity.

* Second, add the child to the parent (using a setter method)

* Third, persist the parent entity.

  * This will create the entity in your db and assign it a generated Primary Key. Without the Primary Key, the child entity would not be able to assign a value as a Foreign Key, and the association in the database would be impossible.

* Finally, persist the child entity.

  * Now, when the row is created in the corresponding table, the parent entities primary key can be assigned to the foreign key column of the child.

* The following example illustrates the mechanics of this process in JPA.

### Example

* If you wish to add a new Rental to the database you will need to build and persist both a *Rental* and a *Payment* entity:


```java
public class PersistMultipleExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  // 1: Create an instance of a Rental entity.
  Rental r = new Rental();

  // 2: Call the various setter methods on your new entity to populate its fields.
  r.setStaff(em.find(Staff.class, 1));
  r.setCustomer(em.find(Customer.class, 1));
  r.setInventoryItem(em.find(InventoryItem.class, 1));
  r.setRentalDate(new Date());
  r.setReturnDate(new Date());

  // 3: Create an instance of a *Payment* entity.
  Payment p = new Payment();

  // 4: Call the setter methods on the *Payment* entity.
  p.setAmount(0.99);
  p.setPaymentDate(new Date());

  // 5: Add the *Payment* to the *Rental* by calling the `addPayment()` method.  
  r.addPayment(p);

  // 6: Persist the *Rental*, then the *Payment* using *EntityManager*â€™s `persist()` method.
  em.persist(r);
  em.persist(p);
  }
}
```
