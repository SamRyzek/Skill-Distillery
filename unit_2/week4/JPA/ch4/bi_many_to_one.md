# Bi-directional `@ManyToOne`

* In a bi-directional, many-to-one relationship, the owning side is mapped just like its uni-directional counterpart.

```java
@Entity
public class Film {
  // ...
  @ManyToOne
  @JoinColumn(name="language_id")
  private Language language;
  // ...
}
```

# Bi-directional `@OneToMany`

* In the non-owning entity of a bi-directional relationship, add the `@OneToMany` annotation above the field that references the owning entity.

  * Use the *mappedBy* element on the `@OneToMany` annotation to specify the defining field in the owning entity.

```java
@Entity
public class Language {
  // ...
  @OneToMany(mappedBy="language")
  private List<Film> films;
  // ...
}
```

  * Make the field of type *Collection*, *List*, or *Set* and give it a plural name.

### Hands *On*:
1: Create a bi-directional, many-to-one relationship between your *Film* and *Language* entities.

* Modify *Film*, add a field of type *Language* annotated with `@ManyToOne` and `@JoinColumn`.

* As a bi-directional relationship, the *Language* entity must also be updated. Add a field of type List<*Film*>, annotate it with `@OneToMany`, and set the *mappedBy* element to the corresponding field in *Film*.

* Also, add get and set methods in each class for the new fields.

2: Update your JUnit tests for *Film* and *Language* to verify that the association works successfully in both directions.â€©
