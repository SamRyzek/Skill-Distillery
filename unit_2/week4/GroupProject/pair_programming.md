# Pair Programming

Pair programming is a development practice where two developers simultaneously work on the same code. It does not involve two developers, each on their own computer working on the same thing and talking back and forth. Instead, each person takes on a role. One, the 'Navigator', does not touch the keyboard, instead, they instruct the other, 'Driver', on what to do and guide them towards the solution. The driver is physically pressing the keys and writing the code, but is following the navigators instructions. At no time should the Driver be talking out loud and typing code following their own direction. Use discipline, stay in your roles, if one of you doesn't understand something, take the time to get on the same page.  

This is not an exercise in tedium, even though it can be frustrating at times.  

Arguably the most important reason to practice pair programming is that it will give you experience communicating with your partner about the code you are working on. One day, when you are the member of a development team, you will not be working in a vacuum, you will need to communicate your blocks, limitations, and hardships to your team. Shedding ego and displaying ignorance will enable you to be brought up to speed and empowered by your coworkers. Similarly, in the classroom you can both learn from and teach your pair.
