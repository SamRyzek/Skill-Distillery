# Presentation
### Create Slides
* After an initial introduction and presentation of your project (deployed & working features), you will want to discuss your project, your group dynamic, your workflow etc. This is where slides come in.

* Place concise code snippets, images of schema...etc...on your slides that highlight some challenges you faced in your application logic, and how you overcame them.

* Discuss group dynamics, things you learned, what you have left to do. Slides will help you organize you discussion, break it into logic chunks, and keep on pace.


### Practice, Practice, Practice...
* Rehearse ahead of time and discuss speaking roles. You will need to have an idea of what is being said in front of what slide so that the person speaking and the person controlling the slides are synced up.

* Dry runs will help you understand how long your presentation takes and help you trim fat. If words/sections feel awkward, this is your chance to fix them.

* Practice facing the audience while speaking. Design your slides such that you don't need to point anything out explicitly (the slides should do that).

### Answer the following questions:
1. Who are you?

2. What did you do?

3. Why did you do it (what problem are you solving)?

4. How did you do it? -> What technologies did you use, methodologies, etc? This is where you show code examples.

5. Why did you do it that way? -> Not required, but is a good time to show off, or justify seemingly strange choices.

6. What do you still have to do? / What could you have done better? -> Developer slang for “I ran out of time and couldn’t implement this feature” or “This code is garbage and has limited functionality, but I know that and I’m going to fix it.”

7. What did you learn?
