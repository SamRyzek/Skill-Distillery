## STS Features

### STS Knows Spring

* When you're in the Spring perspective STS provides Spring-specific views, code assists, refactors, and editors.  

  * STS parses your config files and source code automatically.  

* Notice in the Package Explorer, your project's Spring-y things are marked with an \[S\] icon.

  * Take a look at the *Spring Explorer* view at the bottom right: you'll find a browsable tree of all your bean config files and annotated components.
  
* Open `hello-servlet.xml` from the Spring Explorer.

  * Notice the tabs at the bottom of the editor.  Click `Namespaces` - you can easily add Spring XML Namespace declarations.

    * Check `util`, then look at your source again.

  * Take a look at at the `Beans Graph` tab - not very interesting here but in a more complex app this gives you a graphical view of your bean dependencies.
