## States Lab 3

1. Modify the States web application so that a user can browse through all 50 states one at a time using Next/Previous buttons.  

2. Build a Spring MVC web application that allows browser based clients to access your Pig Latin program.  Copy your existing packages and classes into the new dynamic web project.  Implement JUnit test cases for your controller.  Once you have the basic web interface working, use sessions to display the history of recent translations.
