## Web 101

### Objectives
* Describe the technologies that comprise the World Wide Web.
* Explain and use URLs and URIs.
* Read and understand HTTP requests, responses, and headers.
* Describe how HTML forms interact with the web server and its programs.

### Three key technologies comprise the Internet application we call the World-Wide Web:

1. HTML - you'll continue to gain proficiency in HTML, along with the related technologies of CSS and JavaScript.  These languages define the front-end, user-facing experience of the Web.

2. Uniform Resource Identifiers - URIs provide a concise, consistent way of uniquely identifying and locating a resource on the Internet.

3. HyperText Transfer Protocol - HTTP provides the language in which web clients and servers communicate and transfer resources.  Creating web applications requires expertise in this relatively simple, text-based language, and in the ways it is used.
