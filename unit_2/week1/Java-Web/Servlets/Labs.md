## Labs

1. Modify the Stock web application to display the name of the company in the results instead of the stock symbol.

1. Add additional data to the stocks.txt file such as previous day closing price or 52 week range.  Update Stock.java, StockDAO.java, StockFileDAO.java, and StockServlet.java to present the additional information for the selected stock.

1. Create a lottery number generator web application. Your HTML form should retrieve the number of lottery numbers you wish to generate as well as the range the numbers should be drawn from.  For example, if you were targeting Colorado Lotto which draws six numbers from a range of 1-42, you would send a value of 6 and 42 to the web application.

1. Create a calculator web application whose HTML form contains two text boxes for numeric input as well as add, subtract, multiply, and divide buttons. Build a simple Java class that contains fields that correspond to the two numbers and methods for each calculation option (add, subtract, etc.).  Your servlet should read values from the form, create an instance of your Java class using those values, call the appropriate method on the instance depending on which button was clicked, and generate an HTML response to the user containing the results.
