### CSS basics

#### Overview
We are going to practice targeting and applying styles to these elements. You will create an external stylesheet named `assessment.css`, which is already linked in the HTML file `CSSassessment.html`.  Use NO inline styles - in fact, do not modify `CSSassessment.html` at all: we will apply your stylesheet to our copy of `CSSassessment.html` to assess your work. 

##### User Story #1
Your headers should be changed to your favorite color and set to a size of 1.5em. (Notice they are not all the same tag!)

##### User Story #2
Your table should have bold/colored table headers, as well as a table border. Content should be centered in their respective blocks.

##### User Story #3
Your list should have square list bullets.

##### User Story #4
When the user hovers over a hyperlink the background color of the hyperlink should change and it should not be underlined.

##### User Story #5
Set the background color of the block quote text (2nd paragraph) to a dark color and the font color to a contrasting light color.

##### User Story #6
Make each team's image the background image for the list. **Hint** Check out the `element > element` and `:first-child / :last-child` selectors.

##### User Story #7
The checkbox list should not be bulleted.
