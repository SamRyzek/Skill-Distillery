## CSS Hello World

1. Create an HTML document and open it in you editor (or open an existing document).  
2. Structure a standard HTML document, include a head and body.  
3. Create another file in the same directory as your HTML file. Name it 'myStyles.css'.  
4. Inside of the `<head>` of your HTML document add the following:
   
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="myStyles.css">
   ```  
5. Inside of the body of your document create two `<p>` elements, two unordered lists, and two `<h1>` elements. Assign the same class to one of the `<p>` tags and one of the `<h1>` tags. On the other `<h1>` create an id. Assign two unique id's to the two lists.  
6. In your CSS document target all the `<h1>` tags and give them a `color: red`.  
7. Add the class you assigned to your `<h1>` and `<p>` to your CSS document,  add a property of `font-size: 40px;`.  
8. Add the id you assigned to the second `<h1>` to your CSS document, add a property `color: #29c2d4;`.  
9. On the first list's id add a property `font-weight: bold;`  
10. To the second list of items, change the color of only the first bullet point of the list.
