### HTML Assessment

Use the text editor of your choice to create a new file, assessment.html, with a correctly structured HTML document skeleton including a document title. Inside of this document you are going to be adding elements with their respective section headers, demonstrating your knowledge of basic HTML markup.

* An example of the finished product can be found [here](assessment_example.png). Note it is not very good looking, that's where CSS will come into play!!*
* Add a second-level section header "TEXT", and under it three paragraphs.  The second paragraph should be formatted as a block quotation and emphasized.  The first word of each paragraph should be in bold.
* Add another section header with the title "TABLE" with data to simulate a game score for the Broncos. Creating a table similar to the one shown below, using both colspan and rowspan attributes. Don't worry about styling it, just lay out a table that follows the pattern.  Give the table a header, footer, and caption.

* Create a section header with the title of "LIST". Create a list that organizes the teams by team name, position, and player. Use the default bullets that are provided with an HTML list item.

* Modify the team names above so they are links to the team home pages.  

* Locate logos for each team (Wikipedia is a good source) and use the URLs to place each element next to the team name in the list above.  Use width and/or height attributes to size it to thumbnail size.

* Add a new section with the heading "FORM".  Under it create a form element. Inside of the form add:
  * Give the form input text fields for firstname and lastname.
  * Add a drop-down options list that allows the user to select their favorite sport from a predefined list.
  * Add checkboxes indicating whether they have ever personally played/attended/coached/bet on this sport.
  * Add a radio button group indicating whether they prefer the amateur, college, or professional version.
