## Personal Resume Site Project

### Overview

Starting now and for the rest of the program you are going to build out a personal portfolio site to showcase your work and skills. This should contextualize the HTML and CSS skills you are learning while giving you some meaningful practice. We have broken up the project into steps describing features you can add to your site:

* [Step0](Step0) - Setup
* [Step1](Step1) - Create site home page
* [Step2](Step2) - Basic navigation
* [Step3](Step3) - Frame out content pages
* [Step4](Step4) - Add some basic styling
* [Step5](Step5) - Set up a nav bar
* [Step6](Step6) - Add a contact form
* [Step7](Step7) - Link projects and images


### Requirements

This is a graded assignment, with an initial minimum site required.  The requirements focus on basic site structure and navigation, not style.

After grading your site should keep evolving as you continue through this program and beyond, learning new techniques.
