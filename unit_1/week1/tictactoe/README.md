### Tic Tac Toe

#### Overview

Lets look back at our Tic Tac Toe lab from today. Instead of just printing out X's and O's to the console, we can implement the game's basic functionality. Have two players, alternating turns, insert their symbol (X or O) into a specific location on the 3 x 3 grid. If a player gets 3 in a row they win!!

 *Hint: Remember to use multi-dimensional arrays*

##### User Story #1

The first player is prompted to decide between X or O as their mark. From here we can alternate symbols by turn.

##### User Story #2

The player is then prompted to instruct the game where they would like to put their mark on the 3 x 3 grid.

##### User Story #3

The players should be shown the board after each move, with the current marks of both players.

##### User Story #4

The second player should now be prompted to insert a mark onto the grid, subsequently shown the board with the current marks of both players. Repeat this process alternating players.

##### User Story #5

The game is over when a player places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. The players should be prompted if they would like to play again.
