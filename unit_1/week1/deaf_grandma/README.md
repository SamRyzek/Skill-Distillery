### Deaf Grandma

#### Application Overview

You are going to see your sweet old Grandma. Unfortunately, she can't hear very well (she would never admit it, but she's stone cold deaf). This application will mirror your interactions with Grandma.

##### User Story #1

The user is prompted to say something to Grandma

##### User Story #2

Grandma can only hear the user if the user yells (writes in capital letters)

##### User Story #3

When Grandma doesn't hear you, she yells "HUH? SPEAK UP BILLY!"

##### User Story #4

When Grandma does hear you, she yells "NO, NOT SINCE THE WAR"

##### User Story #5

Grandma will keep trying to have a conversation with you until you yell goodbye

##### User Story #6

When you yell goodbye at Grandma she yells back "SMELL YOU LATER!"

#### Stretch goals

* Can you refactor your code into methods? Can you only call one method in your main and have your program run successfully? Give it a shot.

* Grandma's responses are a little bit limiting, can you give her more expressions? How can you randomly select the crazy things Grandma will say? Change your application so that she's saying one of 10 things each time she hears you and one of 10 different things every time she doesn't.
