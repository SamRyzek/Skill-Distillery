#### Git with it!
* [Git/Github Resources][git]
* [Git Cheatsheet][cheat]

Git is version control software (note, Git and Github are two different things), which you can use as an individual or with a team to persist different states of your code. This is useful if you accidentally create a bug in your program and need to revert back to a previous working version. It is also handy when you have a team of people all working on the same project and need to keep track of what is happening.

This week we are going to get a lot of practice with the following git commands:

* `git status`
* `git add file_name`
* `git commit -m "message"`
* `git branch branchname`
* `git checkout branchname`
* `git push origin branchname`

We are also going to practice writing descriptive commit messages, and talk about what makes a good commit message.

At first git can seem a little scary, but the genius of git is that when you use it, it is much harder to break things (you can always revert!).

#### Github

Github is a cross between a social networking site, giant file share, and project showcase. There you can find open source projects, code samples, documentation for dependencies, pretty much anything open source. It's also a way to display projects to the world (like on a resume), and interact with other developers.

#### Github Pages
* [Getting Started Guide][ghp]

With your Github account you have access to what amounts to a free domain with hosting. Github Pages is a very simple way to get started with your own site, and the documentation for getting it up and running is excellent. Here are two resources that should help you get going, you can Google around for more info on how to make it a little more interesting, or if you ask for one, we can do a lightning talk on some various options.
