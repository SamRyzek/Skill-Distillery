## Sorting and Filtering with Lambdas

Make a copy of your `PresidentApp.java` (so you can keep the original for reference), call it `PresidentAppLambda.java`.  

* In the new copy, replace all inner classes with Lambda expressions.

  * Start by replacing anonymous classes, then replace local and member class instantiations.

* Remove any local or member class definitions from your class.

* Replace any remaining `sort()` or `filter()` calls to use lambdas.

* Modify `filter()` to use `BiPredicate` instead of `PresidentMatcher`.
