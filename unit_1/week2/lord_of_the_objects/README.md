### Lord of the Objects

#### Application Overview
We are going to make a game! Well, as much of a game as you can make in the terminal. You may scoff, but some pretty awesome games were made way before the PC era with only text input. Don't believe me? Check out [Zork][zork].

It is in this spirit that we are going to create our very own 'Lord of the Objects'.

#### User Story #1
When the program starts, the user is welcomed and presented with a list of available commands.

#### User Story #2
The game continues until the user (now called player) either dies (is defeated), or the player retrieves the treasure (or prince/princess/grammy/banana...what-haves-you).

#### User Story #3
The player must fight enemies (trolls/orcs/koopas/Beliebers...etc), who have health and attack damage.

#### User Story #4
Each time an enemy is hit, it will strike back, unless it is dead (defeated).

#### User Story #5
The player takes cumulative damage over time; if the player's health is depleted, the player is defeated.

#### User Story #6
If the player defeats three enemies, they retrieve the treasure and are victorious!

#### Stretch Goals

* The game described above is very simple and extremely linear. Introduce randomness into the damage to spice things up a bit.

* If you've ever played an RPG, you know games like this are all about the gear. Introduce the ability for the player to collect a randomly dropped item after he/she defeats an opponent. Have this item improve the player's stats in some way.

* The world is your oyster! Go nuts! Give the player the ability to move from location to location, have more enemy types, maybe even a boss.
