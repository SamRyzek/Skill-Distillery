#### Continue with Git!

We introduced you to Git and GitHub at a very basic level last week. Moving forward we want you to start using GitHub everyday! Getting comfortable with these tools will also help develop your command line skills, which are a must moving forward as a programmer. Below are all the resources we made available to you last week to help get you started.
