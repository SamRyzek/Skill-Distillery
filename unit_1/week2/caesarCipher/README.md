### Caesar Cipher

#### Overview

In a Caesar’s Cipher, you shift each letter of the alphabet a set amount to encode a message.  For example with a shift of 3, the message “DOG” becomes “GRJ.”  Create two programs, one that encrypts a message and another that decrypts the message.  Both program should prompt the user for the message as well as the shift amount.  To keep things simple, assume only capital letters for the message.  No digits, no punctuation. Start by focusing on encrypting and decrypting single words, then add support for phrases.

 *Hint: Remember characters are simply numbers behind the scenes*

##### User Story #1

The user is asked if he would like to encrypt or decrypt a word.

##### User Story #2

The user is now prompted to input the word in question.

##### User Story #3

The user is now asked by what shift amount they would like to encrypt or decrypt the word.

##### User Story #4

The word is then displayed in its encrypted or decrypted state depending on the selection in step 1. 

#### Stretch goals

* Expand this concept out to decrypt entire phrases.

* Can you deal with punctuation?

* Can you decipher the message "or fher gb qevax lbhe binygvar" with a shift of 13?
