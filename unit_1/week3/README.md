#### New Technologies
We are going to be adding on to a few of the exercises we built over the past few weeks, specifically the Jets program and the Employee Menu. By implementing file IO in our programs we now have the ability to persist data. Reading from files on application start, and writing to files on application close, allows us to mimic the functionality of a database. We will no longer be running static programs!! In addition, we now have the ability to organize our data via collection classes. Collection types such as ArrayLists and HashMaps make the storing and manipulation of data much for fluid. This will afford us endless possibilities when writing our program logic. Experiment with multiple collection types to see which fit your problem the best!

#### Keep using Git
Continue experimenting with version control via Git and GitHub. If you are fuzzy on the process feel free to look back to the previous weeks README or revisit the Git/Github resources we provided [here.][git]
