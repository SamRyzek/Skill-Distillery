# Twitter Message Lab

In Twitter you are allowed to “tweet” messages up to 140 characters long.  Sometimes people need to tweet longer messages, so they split them across tweets.  

1. Write a program that reads in a text file with a long message to tweet and creates a new file whose contents contains multiple tweetable messages each with a length of 140 characters or less.  

2. Modify your program so that you split the tweets on word boundaries.

3. Modify your program again so that the tweets have additional text like “(Tweet 1 of 3)” embedded at the end of each tweet.  Make sure the tweets are still no more than 140 characters.
