## Labs

1: *Card*.java, *Deck*.java, *Rank*.java, and *Suit*.java contain code that simulates a deck of playing cards. Modify *Card*.java and *Deck*.java so that the cards are printed in a sorted order, with rank sorting before suit. 

2: Modify *Deck*.java again so that in addition to printing the sorted cards, you also print out the same cards after they have been shuffled.

3: The access_log file contains records of hits to a web site. Consider each line equivalent to one hit. Write a Java application that counts the number of hits from each unique visitor. Then display the unique visitors along with the corresponding number of total hits. (Hint: Use `String`'s `split()` method to get the first field of each line, which represents the hostname of the visitor.) 

4: (Optional) Modify your *ShowHits* program to sort the displayed records according to the total number of hits.
