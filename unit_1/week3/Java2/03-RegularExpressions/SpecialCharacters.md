## Special Characters

* In an RE, a . matches any single character (except a newline).

* You can narrow things down by using other special characters.

* `\w` - (*word* character) matches any character in the set **A-Z**, **a-z**, **0-9**, or **_**.

  * `\W` - matches any simple character not in that set.

* `\s` - (*whitespace* character) matches a newline, carriage return, formfeed, tab, or space character.

  * `\S` - matches any non-space character.

* `\d` - (*digit* character) matces a digit, **0-9**.

  * `\D` - matches any non-digit character.

* The above are *character classes*; the generalized form of an RE character class is a list of characters in brackets, [].

  * `[A-Za-z_0-9]` is the same as `\w`.

  * `[\n\r\f\t ]` is the same as `\s`.

  * `[0-9]` is the same as `\d`.

  * If the first character after the opening `[` is a caret, `^`, then the character class matches any character not listed.

    * `[^A-Za-z_0-9]` is the same as `\W` â€” any character other than these.

    * `[^AEIOU]` matches any simple character that isn't a capital vowel.
