## Labs

1. Write a program that contains an `ArrayList` of the names of the students in your class. Use a foreach loop to print out each name.  
(Solution: Students.java)

2. Write a program that uses `Math.random()` to build an `ArrayList` of 10 numbers between 0 and 1. Use a standard for loop to print out each number to 3 decimal places.  
(Solution: Numbers.java)

3. Modify your previous solution to sort the numbers and print them. Don't try to develop a sort algorithm on your own, rather search the Internet for existing algorithms like bubble sort or insertion sort. If you have time, try multiple sort algorithms and be prepared to discuss the details of each with a partner.  
(Solution: SortNumbers.java)
