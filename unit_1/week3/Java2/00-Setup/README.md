## Java Book 2 Setup

### Eclipse Working Sets
*Working sets* allow us to organize the projects we see in Eclipse's Project Explorer.  A project can be tagged as belonging to one or more working sets.  When we choose *Working Sets* as the top-level elements displayed by Project Explorer, we can expand or collapse the working sets to see or hide their lists of projects.

#### Configuring Working Sets

##### Create working sets and add projects to them.

1. Find the Package Explorer view menu (the tiny triangle drop-down menu at the upper right of the view.)

2. Choose *Select Working Set...*.

... and add them to the working set:

Click *Finish*.

**BE SURE YOU SELECT ALL THE WORKING SETS TO BE DISPLAYED**

##### Set top-level elements to *Working Sets*

1. In the Project Explorer menu, go to *Top-Level Elements* and choose *Working Sets*.

2. You can now expand and collapse the working sets to make the explorer easier to navigate.  Any projects not added to one of your working sets can be found in **Other Projects**.

### Eclipse Import Course Files

1. Create a new working set, *Java2*.  Don't add any projects to it. Make sure to select it for display.

2. In Package Explorer, select Java2.

3. Go to *File* | *Import...* | *Existing Projects into Workspace*

4. Choose *Select archive file* and *Browse* to the java2.zip you downloaded.  You should see the chapter projects listed for import.  At the bottom of the dialog, *Add to working sets* should show *Java2*.

5. Finish.
