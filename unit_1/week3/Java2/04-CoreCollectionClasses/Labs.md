## Labs

1: Run the application Guess.java and guess how many elements are in the `HashSet`. Now, modify Guess.java to insert `StringBuilder` objects (initialized with identical values) instead of `String` objects into the `HashSet`. Recompile and run the application. How does the output differ? Why? 

2: The program AreaCodeLister.java reads in abbreviations.txt and areacodes.txt. Modify that program so that it loads the data from these files into two `HashMap`s. Then, print out each area code followed by the full name of the state or province associated with it. (Hint: Use `String.split()` to parse the key/value pairs separated by tab, `'\t'`, characters.)

3: Change your solution to the previous lab so that your output is sorted by area code.
