## Labs

1. Create another program similar to PrintBigPlanets.java, but this time print out all planets whose orbit is greater than 200 million miles.
(Solution: PrintDistantPlanets.java)

1. Rewrite your solution to (1) so that it now prints all planets whose orbit is less than 200 million miles.
(Solution: PrintNearPlanets.java)

1. In the chapter directory you will find a program called FilterPresidents.java that reads president information into a List from a file and uses an inner class to print all presidents who are members of the Republican party. Create a similar program that uses lambdas instead of the inner class.
(Solution: Repubilicans.java)

1. Use lambdas to print out all presidents whose term was less than four years.
(Solution: ShortTermPresidents.java)

1. Use lambdas to print out all of the presidents whose last name starts with the letter 'R'.
(Solution: RNamePresidents.java)
