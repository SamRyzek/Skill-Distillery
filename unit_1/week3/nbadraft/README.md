### NBA Draft

#### Application Overview

Each summer the National Basketball Association (NBA) conducts a lottery to determine which team gets the first pick in the upcoming draft.  The fourteen teams that failed to make the playoffs the previous season are eligible to participate in the lottery.  

Letâ€™s assume that the lottery drawing uses 1000 ping pong balls placed in a hopper.  Each ping pong ball has the name of a team on it.  Each team has a different number of ping pong balls in the hopper based on their record.  The team with the worst record (seeded number 1) has a better chance to win the lottery with 250 balls than the team with the best record which has 5 balls in the hopper. The team whose name is listed on the first ball that is drawn is the winner and is awarded the first pick in the draft.

Each team would have the following number of balls:  Seed1 : 250, Seed2 : 199, Seed 3: 156, Seed 4: 119, Seed 5 : 88, Seed 6: 63, Seed 7 : 43, Seed 8 : 28, Seed 9 : 17, Seed 10 : 11, Seed 11 : 8, Seed 12 : 7, Seed 13 : 6, Seed 14 : 5.

Your task is to create an NBA draft simulator that runs 100 simulations and prints out the winner each time.
