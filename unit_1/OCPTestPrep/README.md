### Notes:
* Take other mocks on your own.  
* Review each question you got wrong, as well as the topic it pertains to.  
* Reading alone is not going to make you pass; experience with the tests are. Practice exam, review, repeat.  
  * Copy question code into Eclipse, run, debug, experiment.
* Don't get discouraged, we have people who pass tests that improved from 20's.  
* Ask questions, but we are not here to go over entire tests with you.  
* Take notes on the Chapter topics, see study guide pdf document.  
* Operator precedence tables:

   * What goes in the 3 for(;;) loop expressions?
   * Labels
   * break/continue (including with labels)
   * Iterators
11. Java 8 Lambdas - Brian
   * Curlies, semicolons

     * What fields available in them
     * Time zones
   * Formatting
     * DateTimeFormatter
     * ISO format stuff
13. Methods - Sam
   * local variable declaration
   * variable shadowing
   * returning and assigning values
14. Wrappers - David
   * Passing (question in exam 1)
   * Autoboxing
   * Hierarchy (extend Number, can't cast Float to Integer)
   * Boolean parseBoolean(String)
   * Constructors, valueOf(), typeValue(), parseType(), etc
     

Prepare a 5-10 minute presentation on your topic that you think will reinforce your classmates understanding.

Also write a code example in Eclipse as well as an example test question (you don't need to write a question, find one in the book or testing software).
